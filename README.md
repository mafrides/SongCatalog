SongCatalog
===========

Skeleton N-tier CRUD app with Entity Framework and WPF.  Missing database.

Provides a desktop interface for accessing a song catalog.  Mostly written to play with Async Entity Framework code, multiple tiers, MVVM and WPF.  Also written to make mocking Entity Framework classes feasible, but besides a few unit tests, test suites are incomplete.  Some UI data bindings are broken.
